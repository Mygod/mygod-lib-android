# Mygod Library for Android
This is the library where I collect reusable codes from my Android projects and reuse them for infinity times.

I'd say they are pretty useful, aren't they?

Don't want to use the whole library? Use ProGuard and `shrinkResources` to strip out useless things!

Issues/PRs are extremely welcome.
