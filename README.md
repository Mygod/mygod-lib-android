# Mygod Library for Android

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/Mygod/mygod-lib-android.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Mygod/mygod-lib-android)

The super-powered Android support library written in Scala where it's basically me collecting reusable codes from my Android projects and reuse them for infinity times.

I'd say they are pretty useful, aren't they?

Don't want to use the whole library? Use ProGuard and `shrinkResources` to strip out useless things!

Issues/PRs are extremely welcome.
